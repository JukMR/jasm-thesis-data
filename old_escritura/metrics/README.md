# README

This project was made to do a performance test comparing the improvements in replacing the old string concat method for storing consumed instructions in JASM.

## Running the project

To run the project you should set the method you want to test in JASM, then modify `obtain_metrics.py` and run it. Then you should run `generate_box_plots.py` to generate the box plots.
